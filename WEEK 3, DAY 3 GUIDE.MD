## Suggested Power BI Plots

Given this data structure, here are some suggested Power BI plots:

1. **Total Transactions by Branch**  
   - *Description*: A bar chart showing the number of transactions per branch.

2. **Transaction Volume Over Time**  
   - *Description*: A line chart or area chart showing transaction amounts over time. You can break this down by branch or customer segments.

3. **Branch-Wise Revenue from Fees**  
   - *Description*: A stacked bar chart showing total fee amounts per branch, providing insights into fee revenue distribution.

4. **Customer Transaction Frequency**  
   - *Description*: A column chart showing the number of transactions per customer.

5. **Average Account Balance by Branch**  
   - *Description*: A box plot or clustered bar chart to show variations in account balances across branches.

6. **Fee Amounts by Transaction Amount Range**  
   - *Description*: A scatter plot with transaction amounts on the x-axis and fees on the y-axis.

## Steps to Create Each Plot in Power BI

2. Add a **Bar Chart** to the canvas.
3. Drag the **branch** column to the **Axis** field and **transaction_id** to **Values**.
4. Set the **Values** field to "Count" to show the number of transactions by branch.

### 3. Transaction Volume Over Time
1. Add a **Line Chart** to the canvas.
2. Drag **transaction_date** to the **Axis** field. Adjust to daily or monthly aggregation as needed.
3. Drag **transaction_amount** to the **Values** field to see transaction amounts over time.
4. (Optional) Drag **branch** to the **Legend** field to separate lines by branch.

### 4. Branch-Wise Revenue from Fees
1. Add a **Stacked Bar Chart** to the canvas.
2. Drag **branch** to the **Axis** field and **fee_amount** to the **Values** field.
3. Set **fee_amount** to "Sum" to calculate total fees per branch.

### 5. Customer Transaction Frequency
1. Add a **Column Chart** to the canvas.
2. Drag **customer_id** to the **Axis** field and **transaction_id** to **Values**.
3. Set **transaction_id** to "Count" to show the number of transactions per customer.

### 6. Average Account Balance by Branch
1. Add a **Clustered Bar Chart** to the canvas.
2. Drag **branch** to the **Axis** field and **account_balance** to **Values**.
3. Set **account_balance** to "Average" to show average balances by branch.

### 7. Fee Amounts by Transaction Amount Range
1. Add a **Scatter Chart** to the canvas.
2. Drag **transaction_amount** to the **X-Axis** and **fee_amount** to the **Y-Axis**.
3. Drag **branch** to the **Legend** field to see separate colors per branch.

Each of these charts will help visualize your data in Power BI.
