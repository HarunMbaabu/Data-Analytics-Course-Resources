A **report** provides a detailed, static analysis of data, often with tables, charts, and narrative explanations. Shared periodically, reports give historical insights ideal for managers or analysts needing in-depth information on specific topics, like financials or compliance.

A **dashboard** gives a high-level, real-time overview of key metrics through interactive visuals like charts and KPIs. Dashboards are ideal for quick decision-making, allowing users to adjust filters or drill into data for instant insights, making them popular for tracking ongoing performance.
