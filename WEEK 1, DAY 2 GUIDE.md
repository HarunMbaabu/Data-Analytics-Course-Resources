**WEEK 1 . DAY 2.**

### Topic: Introduction to Excel and Data Entry

#### Objective
By the end of this session, students should be familiar with the Excel interface, basic data entry techniques, and basic formatting tools. They should also understand how to navigate within Excel efficiently.

### 1. Introduction to Excel Interface
Excel is a powerful spreadsheet tool that helps organize, analyze, and visualize data. Hereâ€™s an overview of the key elements of the Excel interface:

1. **Workbook**: The entire Excel file. It can contain multiple sheets.
2. **Worksheet**: The individual tabs within the workbook. Each sheet contains cells where data is entered.
3. **Cells**: The smallest unit where data is entered (intersection of a row and a column).
4. **Columns**: Labeled alphabetically (A, B, C, ...), they run vertically.
5. **Rows**: Labeled numerically (1, 2, 3, ...), they run horizontally.
6. **Ribbon**: The toolbar at the top containing tabs (Home, Insert, Formulas, etc.) with various commands and tools.
7. **Formula Bar**: Located under the ribbon, it displays the content of the selected cell and can be used for entering and editing formulas.
8. **Quick Access Toolbar**: At the top left of the window, it contains frequently used commands (save, undo, redo).

### 2. Data Entry and Navigation

#### 2.1 Entering Data into Excel
- **Text Data**: Type text (e.g., names, labels) into any cell.
- **Numeric Data**: Type numbers directly into a cell (e.g., 25, 100).
- **Dates and Times**: Type dates in a recognized format (e.g., 10/22/2024 or October 22, 2024). Excel automatically formats it as a date.

#### 2.2 Data Entry Example
1. Open Excel and click on **Sheet1**.
2. In Cell **A1**, type "Name".
3. In Cell **B1**, type "Age".
4. In Cell **C1**, type "City".
5. In Cell **A2**, type "John".
6. In Cell **B2**, type "25".
7. In Cell **C2**, type "New York".

The result should look like this:

| Name  | Age | City      |
|-------|-----|-----------|
| John  | 25  | New York  |

#### 2.3 Navigating in Excel
- **Mouse Click**: Click any cell to select it.
- **Arrow Keys**: Move between cells using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
- **Tab/Enter**: Use Tab to move right, and Enter to move down.
- **Shortcut Navigation**:
  - `Ctrl + Arrow Keys`: Jump to the edge of a data range.
  - `Ctrl + Home`: Jump to cell A1.
  - `Ctrl + End`: Jump to the last used cell in the worksheet.

### 3. Basic Excel Functions

#### 3.1 Copy, Paste, and Cut
- **Copy (`Ctrl + C`)**: Copies selected data to the clipboard.
- **Paste (`Ctrl + V`)**: Pastes data from the clipboard into the selected cell.
- **Cut (`Ctrl + X`)**: Moves data to the clipboard and deletes it from the original location.

#### 3.2 Undo and Redo
- **Undo (`Ctrl + Z`)**: Reverts the last action.
- **Redo (`Ctrl + Y`)**: Reapplies an undone action.

#### 3.3 AutoFill
- AutoFill allows you to quickly fill in a series of data (e.g., numbers, dates).
- **Example**: Type "1" in Cell A2 and "2" in Cell A3. Select both cells, then drag the small square in the bottom-right corner of the selection down. Excel will automatically fill the cells with the series (3, 4, 5, ...).

### 4. Basic Formatting
Excel offers various formatting options to make your data more readable and visually appealing.

#### 4.1 Text Formatting
- **Bold (`Ctrl + B`)**: Makes text bold.
- **Italic (`Ctrl + I`)**: Italicizes text.
- **Font Size**: Use the dropdown menu in the Home tab to change the font size.
- **Font Color**: Click the Font Color button (in the Home tab) to change the text color.

#### 4.2 Adjusting Column Width and Row Height
- **Manually**: Hover between two column or row headings (e.g., between A and B) until a double arrow appears. Drag to resize.
- **AutoFit**: Double-click between two headings to automatically resize the column or row to fit the content.

#### 4.3 Wrap Text
- Wrap text allows long text in a cell to appear on multiple lines within the same cell.
- **Example**: Select the cell, go to the Home tab, and click Wrap Text.

#### 4.4 Applying Borders
- To add borders around cells, select the range of cells, go to the Home tab, and choose a border style from the Borders dropdown menu.

#### 4.5 Cell Shading
- To apply a background color to cells, select the cells, go to the Home tab, and choose a color from the Fill Color dropdown.

### Hands-On Practice
1. Format the **Name**, **Age**, and **City** headers by making them bold.
2. Change the font color of the "City" header to blue.
3. Adjust the column width of the "Name" column to fit longer names.
4. Add a border around the entire data table.

### 5. Wrap-Up and Review
#### Key Takeaways:
- The Excel interface consists of key elements such as workbooks, worksheets, cells, columns, and rows.
- Data entry involves typing text, numbers, and dates directly into cells.
- Formatting options like bold, italic, column width adjustments, and cell shading make data clearer and more professional-looking.
- Navigation shortcuts and autofill save time and increase efficiency.

#### Homework:
Create a new Excel file with a list of at least 10 entries. Include:
- A name column,
- A numerical column (e.g., ages or sales figures),
- A location column (e.g., cities or countries),
- Apply basic formatting (bold headers, column width adjustment, wrap text, borders).

Please save your practice file for reference in the next class.
